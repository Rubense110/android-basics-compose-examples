    <string name="aragon_name">Kingdom of Aragon</string>
    <string name="aragon_desc">"The Crown of Aragon emerged as a major power from humble origins as a mere County in the Pyrenees. After winning its independence from the now much reduced Kingdom of Navarra, Aragon entered into a union with the County Barcelona. Its monarchs were eager participants in the Reconquista, the campaign of conquest against the Muslim states of Iberia, which saw Aragon expand to its current southerly extent and add the Kingdom of Valencia to the composite Crown.\n\n"
                "The fates of Aragon and Navarra are once again tied together; the King of Navarra is also the heir to the Aragonese throne. Should King Joan manage to survive his father Alfons V while preserving the independence of Navarra, the two nations will be joined in a personal union under one monarch.\n\n"
                "On the subject of dynastic unions, the Kingdom of Naples in southern Italy is also subject to the Crown of Aragon. Aragon rules Sicily directly, but Naples has yet to be fully integrated into the Crown following King Afonso’s conquest of the kingdom in 1442. The former King of Naples, René of Anjou, has fled to Provence where he continues to insist upon his claim not only on Naples but also on Aragon itself as well as Jerusalem.\n\n"
                "Aragon’s relationship with its powerful neighbour Castile is difficult to pin down. Though these nations share a dynasty, the feuding House of Trastámara is rarely at peace with itself. At times it seems as though peace may be possible and that the two Crowns could be united into one, while at other times it seems that the kingdoms are destined to struggle against one another for eternity as bitter rivals.\n\n"
                "Beyond dynastic matters, Aragon is a nation deeply concerned with dominating trade in the Mediterranean. Aragon’s Consulate of the Sea aims to regulate and administrate all trade in the region, while Catalan and Valencian merchants struggle against merchants from Genoa and Tuscany to control the flow of profit. Aragon also has designs upon the elusive silk trade. Silk has traditionally seen almost no production in Europe; its secrets are closely guarded but now seem to be within reach.</string>

    <string name="ashikaga_name">Ashikaga Shogunate</string>
    <string name="ashikaga_desc">"In name the Empire of Japan is ruled by Emperor Go-Hanazono from Kyoto, the latest in a 2000 year line of emperors. In practice the government of the realm has been left to the Shogun, nominally the emperor's deputy in military matters. However, in 1444 the Shogunate is not what it once was. A number of Ashikaga Shoguns have passed in quick succession over the last few years, due to accidents and assassinations. On multiple occasions raiders have proven that Kyoto is not safe, even for those tasked with keeping the peace in the entire realm.\n\n"
                "Ever since the death of the last strong Ashikaga Shogun, Yoshimitsu, the more powerful clans of the realm have come to rival the Shogunate for power. The leading lords of such clans are known as Daimyo and have almost total power over their respective realms. Some, like the Hosokawa, Hatakeyama and Shiba are closely tied to the shogunate and have monopolized the office of Kanrei, formal deputy of the Shogun. Others, like the Yamana, Akamatsu, Isshiki and Kyogoku assert influence simply through their own wealth and influence.\n\n"
                "Ashikaga Yoshimasa, the current Shogun has begun to attempt to stem these developments, appointing his own close retainers to important positions and taking an active interest in local conflicts in the realm. It remains to be seen if he can save the Shogunate however as other clans have wasted no time capitalizing on the weakness of Yoshimasha's predecessors.\n\n"
                "The growing power of strong Daimyo still threaten to make the Shogunate inconsequential, the rivalry of the Hosokawa and Yamana especially could tear the realm apart as the clans now control a third of the Empire between them.\n\n"</string>

    <string name="austria_name">Archduchy of Austria</string>
    <string name="austria_desc">"In 1438 the Habsburg dynasty had reached some of the most influential positions in Central Europe. Albert the Magnanimous was able to claim not only the duchy of Austria but also the kingdoms of Hungary and Bohemia as well as the prestigious title 'King-Elect of Germany', reserved for those about to be made Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire. Misfortune struck however and Albert fell in battle against the Turks in 1439, leaving only his yet unborn son, Ladislaus the Posthumous, to succeed him.\n\n"
                "Newborn Ladislaus would have a hard time claiming his legacy, and lost the throne of Hungary after a short civil war to the Polish King Wladyslaw. The Kingdom of Bohemia on the other hand is still divided on the issue. Decades of religious civil wars have left the country ravaged with some parts still dominated by powerful Hussite nobles, heretics to the Catholic faith. Only in Austria, the homeland of the Habsburg dynasty, has Ladislaus been accepted, though his uncle Frederick now rules as his regent.\n\n"
                "With the catastrophe of Varna the Hungarian throne is again vacant, and Habsburg supporters remain hopeful that it can be reclaimed for Ladislaus. The powerful groups that deposed the boy king once do not seem disposed to accept him a second time. They may well let their dynamic Hungarian regent Janos Hunyadi lead them instead.\n\n"
                "The dream of a Habsburg Emperor was not lost with Albert. Upon his death, Frederick, the Austrian regent, was elected to lead the Holy Roman Empire. As the first of his family to sit on the Imperial throne Frederick will leave a legacy for future Habsburgs. Should they choose to pursue his careful policies of diplomatic marriages and patient inheritance planning, the Habsburgs may well build up a position of power unlike that of any family among the kings of Europe. The responsibilities of Imperial rule are great obstacles in themselves. An Emperor must keep the peace in the empire, fight heresy such as the recent Hussites and at all costs protect Christianity from the advancing armies of the Ottomans, a power to which the Habsburgs have already lost one King.\n\n"</string>

    <string name="bahmanis_name">Bahmani Sultanate</string>
    <string name="bahmanis_desc">"The sack of Delhi in 1398 was a monumental event for the subcontinent, but in Bidar it did not have the impact it did elsewhere. The Bahmani Sultans declared their independence from the north 50 years prior and had already built a new state in the dry Deccani upland. Rich in economic assets, among others the fabled diamond mines of Golconda, the Sultans are now wealthier than most kings. Their court, and its fabled Turquoise throne, is famous beyond the subcontinent. Fame that greatly helps to attract the greedy and gifted from the wider Muslim world.\n\n"
                "The Bahmani Sultanate is also a troubled state. Cutting ties with the north has meant that it is without direct access to the west. At the same time the kingdom has a much smaller Muslim minority than most northern Sultanates and in its isolation even the most persianate of nobles have begun to adopt local culture and language. Newcomers and indigenized nobles often end up in conflict with each other and the new capital of Bidar has been built partly to avoid the intrigues of the old one in Gulbarga.\n\n"
                "Not far from the kingdom's southern border lies the City of Victory, Vijayanagar. The city is the seat of the Sangama Rajas, and with its 400 000 inhabitants it is a very different place from the orderly fort city of Bidar. This is the capital of an Empire that stretches across Southern India and that has recently conquered almost the entire Tamil country in the far south. Vijayanagar is a formidable rival to Bahmani power, and has continued to advance on the contested zone between the two kingdoms. The seizure of the western Bahmani ports by agents of the Vijayanagara Empire is a strike right at the heart of the Sultanate's lifeline of immigration and imports.\n\n"
                "In the east Kapilendra, founder of the Gajapati dynasty of Orissa, has orchestrated the sudden rise of his kingdom as a military power. Striking at Jaunpur, Bengal, Vijayanagar and Bahmani interests at the same time the new king has in short time made a name for himself as a conqueror. Should he choose to turn his attention south, towards Andhra and Telingana, his actions may shake up the deadlock entirely.\n\n"</string>

    <string name="bengal_name">Bengal Sultanate</string>
    <string name="bengal_desc">"The Bengal Sultanate won its independence from the Tughluq dynasty of Delhi in a long struggle of diplomacy, siegecraft, and warfare that lasted from 1354-1359. Bengal has established itself as a unified and powerful Sultanate over the last century.\n\n"
                "The Sultanate's original Ilyas Shahi dynasty been restored by Sultan Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud, a capable administrator and a man committed to upholding peace and stability. He has thus far presided over the development of Bengal's cities and the construction of magnificent new mosques.\n\n"
                "The most pressing foreign threats facing Bengal are the Gajapati Kingdom  Orissa and the Sharqi dynasty of Jaunpur. The Gajapatis command the loyalty of the Garjat tribes, as they traditionally pledge their loyalty to whichever power controls the major coastal cities. If Bengal can defeat the Orissa kingdom, they might be convinced to extend that same loyalty to the Sultan. Like Bengal itself, the Jaunpur Sultanate broke free from the grip of Delhi, though it has enjoyed its independence only since 1393. Jaunpur controls a vast stretch of the Doab, the great riverine lands of the Ganges. Bengal and Jaunpur came to blows as recently as 1420. Though the conflict came to an abrupt end due to the intervention of Timurid and Ming envoys, many sore issues remain between both nations and further wars may be inevitable.\n\n"
                "Relations with the Buddhist Sultans of Arakan have fluctuated wildly; in one year they are the Bengal’s loyal subjects, in another they are ambivalent allies, and in yet another they are a pirate menace. Future relations with Arakan are likely to be guided just as much by circumstance.\n\n"
                "Bengal is a promising regional hegemon, with great potential for expansion. The Bengal tiger may yet become the sovereign of all India.\n\n"</string>

    <string name="bohemia_name">Kingdom of Bohemia</string>
    <string name="bohemia_desc">"Bohemia is one of the foremost nations in the Holy Roman Empire, its military might and economy wealth second only to the Habsburgs of Austria - the current occupants of the Imperial Throne. In recent times, Bohemia itself was ruled from Austria by Albrecht II, whose death in 1440 left the throne of Bohemia vacant. The question of his succession has not yet been resolved, and the Austrians are likely to press their claims.\n\n"
                "In addition to uncertainties surrounding the succession, Bohemia comes off the back of several decades of struggle between its rulers and the Hussites, who many in the Catholic world view as heretics. Although the radical Hussite faction was defeated, the moderate Taborite faction, led by Jiri Podebrad, remain influential and will surely wish to have their say in the question of succession - and in other matters.\n\n"
                "Further threats - but also potential allies - lie to the east, in the mighty nations of Poland and Hungary. Both have been thrown into chaos by the death of Wladislaw III Jagiellon at the hands of the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Varna. This has left them leaderless, with Hungary looking particularly vulnerable, but their strength should not be underestimated. An ambitious Bohemian king could use the situation to his advantage and gain valuable allies - or valuable new land - for the throne.\n\n"
                "In Germany, many of the Imperial Princes view Bohemia as outsiders - despite its status as an Elector - due to cultural differences and worry about living in its comparatively large shadow. An expansionist king might look for fresh conquests among them, but their support will be necessary for any fresh push towards becoming the Holy Roman Emperor. Choices abound lie ahead, with many threats and opportunities for the Kingdom of Bohemia to navigate…\n\n"</string>

    <string name="brandenburg_name">Margraviate of Brandenburg</string>
    <string name="brandenburg_desc">"The recent history of the March of Brandenburg has been a sad state of affairs. With poor soils, swamps and wild forests Brandenburg is not the richest lands of the Holy Roman Empire and under Wittelsbach and Luxemburg rule the region has been treated as a source of quick income. With the ascendence of the Hohenzollern Dynasty things have slowly begun to change. Friedrich I spent his entire reign wearing down the influence of the Brandenburg estates and fighting the prevalent lawlessness, sending his armies against the castles of the many robber barons that have for long had a free reign over the region.\n\n"
                "In many ways Friedrich II, 'the Iron', has proven to be his father's son, resuming the policies intended to crush the power of local potentates and greedy burghers. He has also sent out feelers to the Order for the reclamation of Neumark, a land originally part of Brandenburg, but pawned by his predecessors.\n\n"
                "The difficulty in asserting state power is amply demonstrated by the Kalmar Union kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, where a king attempting to achieve similar goals was recently deposed and replaced by a Bavarian Wittelsbach. If Brandenburg is to be made a durable state it must also remain united, avoiding squabbles like those among the Wettin heirs in Electoral Saxony to the south.\n\n"
                "The nearby kingdoms of Poland and Bohemia are both without rulers in 1444, one as a direct result of the failed Crusade of Varna against the Ottomans, and the other due to the rejection of the Habsburg heir Ladislaus the Posthumous by the Bohemian nobility. Despite the Bohemian lands still not having recovered from the Hussite wars of the last decades the Heretic Hussites remain a strong factor in Bohemian politics, making the kingdom a cause for concern among all its neighbors, Brandenburg included.\n\n"</string>

    <string name="burgundy_name">Duchy of Burgundy</string>
    <string name="burgundy_desc">"The Bourgogne branch of the Valois dynasty not only rules the duchy of Burgundy, de jure a French possession, but also a significant part of the Low Countries, Vermandois and the county of Nevers. In short time they have created a realm that straddles some of the richest parts of France and the Holy Roman Empire. Taken together the dukes of Burgundy command enormous wealth. These economic resources have been used by Philippe III, the Good, to expand the influence of his family even further, acquiring title after title along the Meuse and Rhine in an attempt to connect his realm.\n\n"
                "While France has spent the last century being torn asunder in the on-going feud between English and French claimants to the French throne, Burgundy has grown to be the cultural and economic center of western Europe. Nowhere are the knightly ideals of the late middle ages as alive as in Burgundy, with great tournaments, grand feasts, and of course the Order of the Golden Fleece itself. A knightly order created by the Duke, aspiring to recreate the knighthood of the Arthurian legends or Greek myths. The Burgundian court also dominates fashion and art, with fortunes being spent on silk, paintings and fantastic illuminated manuscripts.\n\n"
                "The Duchy of Burgundy already rivals many kingdoms in influence, income and even military might. By playing off the English and French against each other the Dukes have for a long time been practically independent. De jure however the Dukes remain both subjects to France and to the Holy Roman Empire. With the Hundred Years War nearing, what looks like, its conclusion, the future of the Duchy seems uncertain. If it continues its meteoric rise Burgundy could be the embryo of a new kingdom. A strong state in the middle of Western Europe. But the dukes have also gained many enemies in this short time. Should Philippe and his successors play their cards right there may be a crown in their future, but that requires taking risks that might well cost them everything, potentially reducing their glorious domain to a footnote in the annals of history.\n\n"</string>

    <string name="byzantium_name">Byzantine Empire</string>
    <string name="byzantium_desc">"With the Roman Empire now a distant memory for nearly a thousand years, countless Empires have dared to take the mantle as the true successors to Rome, but the Byzantines remain adamant that they hold the only legitimate claim to that ancient Empire. In 1171, the rivalry between Byzantium and Venice reached a boiling point as the nations’ hostilities towards each other erupted into violent conflict.\n\n"
                "In April 1204, guided by the vengeful spirit of the Venetians, the members of the Fourth Crusade defied the command of Pope Innocent III and turned their violence towards the Byzantine Empire which had promised them safe passage. The Crusaders ravaged the city of Constantinople two times over, reducing the once glorious city to little more than ash and rubble, and reducing the Empire to little more still. Although the House of Palaiolgos was able to restore much of what was lost, countless successor states such as the Theme of Epirus and Naxos have managed to evade reintegration with the Empire. The chaos created by the fall of the Byzantine Empire has given rise to the Ottoman Turks who now situate themselves on the Byzantine border with the ambition to claim Constantinople, the City of World’s Desire, for themselves.\n\n"
                "In 1444, Byzantium finds itself only holding the City of Constantinople and surrounded by heretics and heathens on all sides; with many of their old subjects now bending the knee to the Venetian Doge who sparked the end of their empire, and many others now firmly under the control of the Ottomans.Powers in both the West and East believe that the age of Byzantium is long since over, but Basilius Ioannes VIII Palaiolgos remains confident that the Purple Phoenix shall rise once again and reclaim not just Byzantium, but the Roman Empire itself!\n\n"</string>

    <string name="castile_name">Kingdom of Castile</string>
    <string name="castile_desc">"Shaped in the battles of the Reconquista, the Crown of Castile is in fact not just one kingdom but a union of the kingdoms of Castile, León, Toledo, Galicia, Murcia, Jaén, Córdoba and Seville under the Castilian branch of the Trastámara dynasty. What remains of the Moorish presence in Iberia is now restricted to the southern kingdom of Granada, still a rich Muslim sultanate in many ways but also marred by infighting and the frequent border skirmishes with Christian raiders. Surrounded on all sides by Castilian castles it seems to be a matter of time before the Reconquista is brought to its logical conclusion and the kingdom is annexed.\n\n"
                "For now however Castile has problems of its own. The Castilian Nobles and the local Cortes of the various constituent kingdoms still hold a large degree of power and many Trastámara kings have found themselves at the mercy of the estates of their kingdoms. Factions acting entirely out of their own interests have not shied away from supporting foreign pretenders from Portugal and Aragon in the past.\n\n"
                "If the kingdom can be united by a strong ruler, and the Reconquista completed, Castile will have a fearsome military force in its hands with a long tradition of fighting for the expansion of the Christian faith. While Castile lacks the seafaring tradition of neighboring Portugal they have just as good access to the Atlantic Ocean and the new trade routes that are opening up to the west and south-east.\n\n"</string>

    <string name="delhi_name">Sultanate of Delhi</string>
    <string name="delhi_desc">"Founded by the Turkic Mamluk dynasty in 1206, the Delhi Sultanate began as a regional power in the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Under the Tughlaq dynasty it grew into the largest Indian empire the world had seen since the Guptas. The empire spanned from Sindh to Bengal, from Kashmir to the Coromandel Coast.\n\n"
                "The Tughlaq empire collapsed as quickly as it rose to power. Though it is a Muslim state ruling over many millions of Hindus, its downfall was orchestrated by ambitious Muslim generals rather than popular Hindu resistance. In 1347 the entirety of southern India was lost in the revolt of general Ala-ud-Din Hasan Bahman Shah, who declared himself ruler of the new Sultanate of Bahmanis.\n\n"
                "More recently, the Sultanate suffered a catastrophic blow when the Sharqi governors of Jaunpur broke away in 1394, taking with them a vast stretch of the Indo-Gangetic Plain and reducing the Sultanate's influence to an area barely beyond the city walls. Mahmud Shah, Sultan of Jaunpur, eyes his neighbors hungrily; he has designs not only on the throne of Delhi, but also on the nearbyBengal Sultanate and the Gajapati Kingdom of Orissa. The Sultan's ambitions threaten to engulf all of northern India.\n\n"
                "The final nail in the Tughlaq's coffin came with the brutal Timurid invasion in 1398. The fearsome warlord had no intention of beginning a conquest of India, instead setting his armies to loot and burn and massacre all that they laid eyes upon. In the midst of the chaos, the Tughlaq dynasty was finally overthrown by the Sayyid governors of Delhi. The upstart Sayyids have thus far entirely failed to put an end to the catastrophe facing the Sultanate. Only the Rajputs of Jangladesh remain truly loyal to the Sultan in this period of ruin.\n\n"
                "Just as the Sayyids rose from governors to Sultans, another powerful governor has risen in Sirhind. Bahlul Lodi, an Afghan noble, is an extremely adept governor and military leader. His control of the Punjab gives him a dangerous degree of power, which he is likely to leverage in a bid to seize control of Delhi itself. The Sayyid Sultan hides in his palace as Lodi gathers his strength in preparation for a rebellion. The Delhi Sultanate is in the midst of collapse. Many covet the throne, but will a new conqueror rise to restore the Sultanate, or shall it be consigned to history as a symbol of doomed ambition?\n\n"</string>

                "The Danish monarchy has many enemies however, in particular among the cities of the Hanseatic League, an alliance of free cities in control of the Baltic trade that Denmark now threatens.

                "With the treaty of Tours in May, the English Lancasters and French Valois families have seemingly traded territory for peace. Among its stipulation are the handover of the county of Maine, a point that was never cleared with the English Parliament, and which is likely to anger noble and commoner alike on the far side of the channel. The fear of public backlash has so far lead to this handover being stalled for months, with the word of the English negotiators increasingly being questioned in the French court.\n\n"
                "England is itself in a precarious situation. A king since he was nine months old, Henry VI has now grown up to assume the crown and actual rule of the kingdom. Even as an adult however Henry seems unwilling to rule, some would say he is even worryingly detached from reality. Intriguing nobles of the realm have instead come to dominate Henry's regime, assuming power and positioning themselves for a future succession. Such feuds might well cripple the internal stability of the Kingdom, especially if hostilities in France commence again.\n\n"
                "With the English busy with continental and internal affairs the dominion over Ireland has shrunken to a thin strip along the sea known as 'The Pale', with Gaelic lords as well as Hiberno-Normans acting entirely independent of the English Crown.

Charles has also been acknowledged as the rightful King by the Dukes of Burgundy in the treaty of Arras in 1435.\n\n"

                "While the Burgundians now passively support the French cause in the conflict with England, they are still a matter of concern for the French Crown.

To our North are the English who wish to add the French Crown to their collection, and to our East is the rebellious House de Bourgogne who would dare to claim the throne for themselves. Before the French can even begin thinking about expanding their Empire, they must first ensure the loyalty of their subjects and integrate them into a centralized state, and remove the cursed English and Burgundian pretender Kingdoms from their border.

    <string name="greatHorde_desc">"The Golden Horde is dead; its Tatar successors fight over its corpse even as their enemies grow strong around them. The once great empire of Jochi, son of Genghis Khan, has been divided into several Khanates each seeking dominance over the steppe. The most direct successor to the Golden Horde is the Great Horde§. Controlling the cities of Sarai and Astrakhan, Khan Küchük Muhammad pronounces his hegemony over the steppe to deaf ears. The constituent tribes continue to break away from his rule and the Khan has thus far been unable to stop them. A Khan who is not feared even by his neighbors is barely a Khan at all; once mere tax-collectors, the Grand Principality of Muscovy has expanded greatly without a strong Khan to keep them in check. If they are left to grow they will surely seek to throw off the Tatar yoke entirely and conquer the steppes for themselves.\n\n"
                "Likewise, Lithuania has benefitted from the collapse of the Golden Horde. They have already stolen Ruthenia away from Tatar control and will likely continue to pose a threat to the nomads. Muhammad of Kazan has twice proclaimed himself Khan of the Golden Horde, but his reigns were short-lived. With the support of local Bolghar nobles he seized the city of Kazan and established a new Khanate in the northern steppe. Kazan is an important trade hub, and the new Khanate can easily access nearby veins of metals both precious and utilitarian. As the wealthiest of the Tatar realms, Kazan is both a promising state and a target for greedy invaders.\n\n"
                "The Crimean Khanate broke from the Great Horde in 1441 after the Crimean clans invited Haci Giray, a descendent of Ghenghis Khan, to rule them. Giray led the Crimean Tatars in a bloody struggle for independence, eventually emerging victorious and as Khan of a new horde. The Crimeans are avid slavers, and must contend with the Genoese colonies for control of local trade. They have also attracted the interests of the Ottoman Sultan, who keeps a watchful eye over the Khanate’s affairs. The Nogai and Uzbek Khanates, while successful in their bid for independence and controlling vast stretches of the steppe, lack the wealth or strategic importance of the other successor states. Opportunism must be their guiding philosophy if they wish to claim any part of Genghis Khan’s legacy, and by great fortune it seems that their Timurid neighbors are close to collapse and civil war. A worthy Khan might take the chance to seize the cities of Samarkand or Bukhara while the Timurids are distracted.\n\n"</string>

A man of great renown and many talents, he is seen by many in Hungary as Wladislaw's natural successor. However, the Habsburgs of Austria are keen to press their own claim through the infant, Ladislaus Postumus, who was the heir apparent before Wladislaw took the throne through a civil war.

On the other hand, Bohemia, a hotbed of the Hussite heresy, may offer a more attractive target for expansion, especially if the Holy Roman Emperor's approval can be secured… and if the Ottomans can be kept at bay long enough.\n\n"</string>

    <string name="korea_name">Joseon Kingdom of Korea</string>
    <string name="korea_desc">"The Joseon Kingdom of Korea, officially the Kingdom of Great Joseon, emerged from the ashes of Mongolia and Ming invasions via a coup d'état by General Yi Seonggye (later known as King Taejo) in 1392. From the start, Joseon Korea's connection to Ming China was strong: When settling on a name for the new kingdom, Taejo submitted the options 'Hwaryeong' and 'Joseon' to Ming and decided on the latter after its endorsement by the Emperor.\n\n"
                "This close connection to Ming China was to remain until the downfall of the Ming in the mid-17th century - as was Korea's subordinate status in the relationship. As followers of Confucianism, Koreans viewed China as being at the heart of the Korean world, and Joseon Korea came to be in some ways even more sinicized than China itself - a 'little China'. For their part, the Chinese viewed Joseon Korea as the 'country of courteous people in the East.' For as long as Ming remains the undisputed claimant to the Mandate of Heaven, the maintenance of these strong bonds will remain vital to the survival of the fledgling Korean kingdom.\n\n"
                "The achievements of the first century of Joseon rule were considerable. In the early 15th century, the border regions of Gyeongseong and Yukjin were taken from the Manchu, allowing the Koreans to unite the territory which would form modern-day Korea. There was also a flourishing of academia and knowledge. In particular, the hangul alphabet was introduced in 1446. Unlike the Chinese alphabet, it was designed to be both easy to learn and easy to adapt to the Korean language, making its use far more convenient and allowing a far broader section of society to read scholarly texts. Further notable progress was made in the fields of agriculture, gun powder and the codification of the law, and major efforts were made to survey and recorded the geography of the land.\n\n"
                "However, threats to the Korean kingdom remain from both within and beyond its borders. At home, Korea's peasants remain poor, and both peasant uprisings and insufficient tax receipts are likely to become a problem if nothing is done to rectify the situation. Furthermore, although the upper class of yangban elites has for the most part been united, the cracks in this façade are already beginning to show and could erupt into factional strife at anytime.\n\n"
                "On the foreign front lie threats aplenty. To the north await the warlike Manchu - although presently divided, should they come to be unified under a strong leader, an invasion of Korea might follow swiftly. Similarly, across the sea to the east lies Japan, a nation of warring daimyos and would-be shoguns. Korea must be vigilant, lest a united Japan seek to expand its power across narrow channel of the Korean Sea. Finally, although Korea basks in the shadow of the Ming Empire, woe betide the Joseon prince who wakes the dragon!\n\n"</string>

    <string name="mamluks_desc">"Once the elite of the Ayyubid armies, in 1250 the Mamluks went from slave servants to the masters of a realm at the very heart of the Islamic World. From their capital in Cairo the Mamluk households control Egypt and Syria as well as the Abbasid Caliph himself. In the north Mamluk influence is felt from the beyliks of Anatolia to the shores of Lake Van. In the south they serve as protector of the Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina in the Hejaz as well as influencing the politics of Yemen. Even the Christian empire of Ethiopia must be attentive to the word of the Mamluk Sultan, as the Coptic pope, the ordainer of all Ethiopian bishops, is under Mamluk care.\n\n"
                "The Mamluk amirs reproduce their ranks by purchasing new mamluks, foreign slaves mostly of Circassian origin. These slaves are then trained as soldiers or stewards, who all swear allegiance to their buyer, or 'foster-father'. The amirs in turn put their household to use in the service of the sultans. When the time for succession comes it is in practice the will of these powerful men that determines which amir will become the next sultan. This system ensures that the sultanate is never short of elite warriors, so long as the route to import more slaves from the Black Sea lies open. However, as a governing system it has more than once lead to damaging conflicts and paralyzing factionalism.\n\n"
                "The future looks bright for the Mamluk Sultanate however, as the death of Timur has removed the greatest threat in the region, with the once expansive Timurid Empire now reduced to a few bickering successor states in Persia and Transoxiana. The vacuum left by this empire in Anatolia, the Caucasus and Iraq has been filled by the Qara Qoyunlu Federation in the east, and the resurgent Ottoman Empire in the west. Both seem destined to come into conflict with the Mamluks in the near future.\n\n"
                "The wealth of the sultanate is fed by the trade that flows through its Egyptian lands, bridging the distance between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. This places great demands on the Mamluk fleets to battle Christian pirates in the north as well as to protect the huge vulnerable vessels that follow the Hejaz coastline with coffee, cloth and spices through the Red Sea.\n\n"
                "As 1444 draws to an end the Mamluk Sultanate is still the largest, richest and strongest state in the Middle East, it has many enemies but fears few of them.\n\n"</string>

    <string name="milan_desc">"Milan in 1444 comes off the back of numerous wars for hegemony over northern Italy since 1423. The ambitious Duke, Filippo Maria Visconti, sought to expand Milanese power against Venice, Florence and Genoa, but these attempts ended in failure despite initial successes. Although there is currently a lull in the fighting, peace is unlikely to last: Venice controls rightful Milanese possessions in Brescia and Bergamo. Rulers on all sides are gathering their troops for a fresh round of fighting.\n\n"
                "A relatively young state, the Duchy of Milan was founded in 1395. Since then, its rulers have fought hard within the state as much as beyond its borders to establish their authority. Lombardy's cities are however only reluctantly accepting of ducal rule and are likely to attempt to seize power for themselves and establish a republican form of governance, should they get the chance. On the other hand, the ambitious and highly skilled mercenary captain Ludovico Sforza has made a reputation for himself during the latest struggles. He too would seize any opening to further his own ambitions. Instability is sure to plague Milan until these tensions can be resolved.\n\n"
                "Finally, the competing expansionist powers of France and Austria eye the Duchy, and are likely to view it as the prize should one achieve supremacy over the other. Milan will have to pick a side carefully, while ensuring that it is not so beholden to them that it loses control of its own fate. In particular, Milan will have to decide whether to remain a part of the Holy Roman Empire, which has gradually seen its control of Italy slipping away, or whether to seek independence from it and strike out its own path. The success of Milan shall be dependent on the careful balancing of its diplomatic relations - and on securing a more successful outcome to its wars than in the first half of the century.\n\n"</string>

    <string name="ming_name">Great Ming</string>
    <string name="ming_desc">"The Great Ming Empire owes its origins to the collapse of the Yuan dynasty from Mongolia and the period of rebellion and strife that struck China in the mid-14th century. From this age of chaos, the Ming emerged as the greatest power in China, eliminating their Han rivals and pushing the descendants of Kublai Khan back to the Great Wall. After eighty years of governance, the Ming have firmly established themselves as the preeminent power in East Asia.\n\n"
                "Even though Ming continues to prosper, its international presence has flagged since the end of Zheng He's voyages, and new realms have posed fresh challenges to the empire. In the divided north, nomads have begun to coalesce under the leadership of the Oirat warlord Esen, who aspires to become the new Great Khan of all the Mongols. Ming diplomacy at least prevented a similar movement from happening among the Jurchen tribes to the northeast, where Imperial policy has encouraged infighting among the nomads. While the fractious and distracted Jurchens are unlikely to pose a threat any time soon, Esen's Oirats may prove to be a very formidable foe indeed.\n\n"
                "Ming's relations in the south are somewhat better. Dai Viet freed itself from Ming domination only two decades prior, and still remains wary of its Chinese neighbor to the north. Other powers in the region have a more positive opinion of Ming, but mountains and jungles mean that Ming receives little more than token tributes from the southern kingdoms.\n\n"
                "Ming's relations are strongest with the Joseon dynasty of Korea. Both Ming and the Joseon dynasty emerged from the ashes of the Great Yuan, and thanks to their common adherence to Confucian philosophy both have maintained strong bonds ever since.\n\n"
                "Not all of Ming's troubles are external; the Mandate of Heaven is a fickle one, and if the Emperor's authority wavers too much then there are those who may choose to shun the Ming altogether. China would have to fall far indeed to reach such dire straits; in the 15th century, the Great Ming Empire is by far the strongest realm in Asia, and quite possibly on Earth!\n\n"</string>

The Tatars have been ever present in Russian politics, collecting tribute, taxes and acting as kingmakers in the Christian states. While the Grand Principality of Muscovy is not the oldest of these states it has recently grown to be the strongest. Located in the relatively fertile Opolye, Muscovy has a stronger internal economy than many other principalities. More importantly their princes have often acted as collectors for the Khans of the Golden Hordes. Making their princes both relatively safe and able to grow rich.\n\n"

The core of their empire, the Great Horde is still a strong power in its own right, but it is fraught by internal struggles and has been unable to project much power over the Russians.\n\n"
                "Muscovy has made good use of this power vacuum, expanding their control over the other principalities rapidly, through both cunning and use of military resources. Often even by simply buying out the poorer Princes and adding their lands to the Muscovite domain.\n\n"
                "Moscow is not the only strong state with interest in the Russian region, however, in the north the Republic of Novgorod has colonized much of the White Sea coastline, securing the valuable waterways and a source of fur, the soft gold of the north and east.\n\n"

Their interests are directly opposed to the growing power of Moscow, but their claim to the Rus legacy is quite dubious. If they can be overcome there is seemingly no limit to how much the Great Principality could grow.\n\n"
                "If the Tatar Yoke could be crushed once and for all there is also the vast expanse of Siberia, full of untold riches, and dangers.

The sultan's authority is enforced only by his small household of servants, recruited from slaves captured in war and from the 'devshirme', the periodic conscription of Christian youths from the Balkan countryside. These are the famous Janissaries, who will in time grow into a powerful standing army. The Ottomans have come to power with the military backing of numerous marcher-lords, still highly autonomous on the Balkan frontier, while the administration lies in the hands of the Turkish aristocracy, literate in the ways of statecraft, but largely independent of the sultan's authority.\n\n"

This cooperation has allowed the two countries to thrive despite their many enemies, but integrating the nobility of two such divergent states has not been an easy matter.
